## Notes

Lambda@Edge functions requires CloudFront distribution during deployment.
- Removing lambda functions (`sls remove`) fails if the functions are associated with CloudFront distribution. The functions need to be removed from the distribution or the delete the distribution to successfully run `sls remove`.
  - Too many hurdles to remove functions.
  - Uncertain if `sls` or any plugins have the ability to remove old versioned functions that's not used in a distribution or unassociate functions from distribution for removal.
  - What then?
    - Perhaps Lambda@Edge functions should always deploy new version. A separate process would be needed to delete old versions that's not used in distributions.

- If I deploy (`sls deploy ...`), does it always create new version?

Hardcoding CloudFront distribution in serverless.yml or have serverless generate a distribution during build?
